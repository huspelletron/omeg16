#### VISA:

You may need a visa to enter Vietnam even for a short visit.

Citizens of the ASEAN countries, Belarus, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, Italy, R. Korea, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and UK may not need a visa for a short visit.

In case you need an assistance from the Organizers in applying for a visa, please contact the OMEG16 secretariat (omeg16@iop.vast.ac.vn). 

In some cases, it is possible to get a "visa on arrival" at the border checkpoint in a Vietnamese international airport (it is more safe to apply for it before your departure).
